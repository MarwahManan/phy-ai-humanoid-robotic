# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Vision
The purpose of this book is to provide an accessible and comprehensive introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics for beginners to intermediate learners. This book aims to transform curious readers into capable practitioners who understand both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of humanoid robotics, enabling them to build, program, and interact with physical AI systems effectively.

## Core Principles

### Clarity
All content must be presented with crystal-clear explanations, avoiding unnecessary jargon. Complex concepts should be broken down into digestible segments with visual aids, analogies, and step-by-step instructions that make advanced topics approachable for the target audience.

### Simplicity
Start with fundamental concepts and gradually build complexity. Each chapter should focus on one core idea at a time, providing simple examples before moving to more sophisticated applications. Avoid overwhelming learners with too much information simultaneously.

### Hands-On Learning
Every theoretical concept must be paired with practical exercises, code examples, and real-world projects. Learners should be able to immediately apply what they've learned through guided tutorials, experiments, and build-along projects that reinforce understanding.

### Free-Tier Friendly
All examples, tools, and platforms referenced in the book must be accessible through free tiers or open-source alternatives. No learner should be required to purchase expensive hardware, software, or cloud services to complete the book's exercises and projects.

### Technical Accuracy
All content must be technically accurate and up-to-date with current best practices in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Code examples should be tested and verified, with clear explanations of underlying principles and potential limitations.

### Accessibility
Content should be designed to be accessible to readers with diverse backgrounds, including those without extensive programming or robotics experience. Provide prerequisite knowledge summaries and multiple learning pathways to accommodate different starting points.

## Success Criteria

### Clean Build
The Docusaurus documentation site must build without errors, warnings, or broken links. All code examples should be properly formatted with syntax highlighting and runnable without modification.

### Readability
Content should be easily readable with clear navigation, logical chapter progression, and consistent formatting. The book should maintain a consistent voice and terminology throughout all sections.

### Practical Application
Each chapter should include actionable exercises that allow learners to immediately apply concepts. Projects should be achievable by the target audience and provide meaningful learning outcomes.

### Technical Correctness
All code examples, diagrams, and technical explanations must be accurate and reflect current best practices in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Any deprecated methods or technologies should be clearly marked.

## Constraints

### No GPU Requirements
All examples and projects must be runnable without requiring specialized GPU hardware. Any GPU-dependent content should be clearly marked as optional or include CPU-based alternatives.

### Lightweight Implementation
Examples should be designed to run efficiently on standard consumer hardware. Avoid resource-intensive implementations that would prevent learners from following along on typical laptops or desktops.

### Beginner-Friendly Focus
Advanced topics should be introduced gradually and always include sufficient context for beginners. Avoid assuming extensive prior knowledge in robotics, AI, or complex mathematics.

## Stakeholders

### Learners
Primary audience consisting of beginners to intermediate practitioners interested in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Their success in understanding and applying the content is the primary measure of the book's value.

### Educators
Instructors and teaching assistants who may use this book as a resource for courses or workshops. The book should serve as a comprehensive reference and teaching aid.

### Maintainers
Technical writers, developers, and subject matter experts responsible for updating and maintaining the book over time. The structure should facilitate easy updates and extensions.

## Brand Voice

### Clear
Use plain language and avoid unnecessary technical jargon. When technical terms are necessary, define them clearly and provide context for their use.

### Friendly
Maintain an approachable, welcoming tone that encourages experimentation and learning. Avoid condescending language or assumptions about reader knowledge.

### Practical
Focus on real-world applications and immediately useful knowledge. Emphasize how concepts apply to actual robotics projects and problem-solving scenarios.

## Governance

This constitution serves as the foundational document that guides all content creation, updates, and maintenance for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book. All contributors must ensure their work aligns with the stated principles, success criteria, and constraints. Any significant changes to the book's direction or approach must be reviewed against this constitution and documented with appropriate justification.

All content reviews and quality checks must verify compliance with the principles of clarity, simplicity, hands-on learning, free-tier accessibility, and technical accuracy. The book should continuously evolve while maintaining its commitment to beginner-friendly, practical education in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
